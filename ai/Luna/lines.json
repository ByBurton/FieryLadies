  "description"  : "How had she been reduced to this? She was once the Scourge of the Plains, a merciless leader of men and beasts, and able to sow terror wherever she dared. Now she was far from her homeland, driven half mad from starvation and months of wandering, her army long dead or worse. But when she was at her lowest, Selemene, the Goddess of the Moon, chose her to take up a new mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the ruthless and ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods.",
